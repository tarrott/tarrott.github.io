# Algorithms
- algorithm categories
- how long does the algorithm run with 1,000 records and does it scale to 1 million?
- common sense estimation
    - O(n): simple loops (1 to n)
    - O(n^2): nested loops
    - O(lg(n)): binary chop (halves the set it considers each time it starts the loop)
    - O(nlg(n)): divide and conquer (partition input, work on partitions separetly, and then combine results)
        - degrades to O(n^2) when fed sorted imput
    - O(2^n): combinatoric (permutations)
